# Navigation Applicaiton
this application is designed to allow users to meet one another at a location that is the least distance from all of them. this is done via collecting the user's locations, and by allowing users to join groups. once part of a group the meeting place can be calculated at any time. this calculation is done by taking the average of all the usersâ€™ longitudes and latitudes.

once this information has been calculated navigation to the meeting place can be done. this navigation is made possible by use of the google maps API. the data that this application uses is stored in a local database.
